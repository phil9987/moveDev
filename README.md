# One Life - the key to a healthier, more productive life

When working on an important project, many people forget to take a break from time to time. This does not only decrease the productivity but is also unhealthy, as most jobs today are executed while sitting on a chair.
One Life provides a solution for companies, to motivate their employees to make breaks from time to time and interact with each other.
Through a strategic game and a company-wide challenge we give every employee a reason to move and invest in his health, enhance his productivity while at the same time have a good time.
